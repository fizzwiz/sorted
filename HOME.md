# @fizzwiz/sorted

**Sorted collections for JavaScript â€” powered by expressive equivalence and queue-based selection.**

The `@fizzwiz/sorted` library introduces sorted data structures to JavaScript, enabling powerful abstractions built around ordering, selection, and equivalence.

## âœ¨ Why Use This Library?

### ðŸ§¬ Search-and-Select Pattern

At its core, `@fizzwiz/sorted` provides sorted queues â€” essential for implementing the `Search-and-Select` pattern. This pattern from [`@fizzwiz/pattern`](https://pattern.blog.fizzwiz.cloud) offers a clean, declarative approach to exploring solution spaces, particularly when paired with constructs like `Each` and `What` from [`@fizzwiz/fluent`](https://fluent.blog.fizzwiz.cloud).

### ðŸ“£ A New Perspective on Equivalence

This library also introduces a novel approach to **object equivalence**. Unlike JavaScript's built-in equality (which only applies reliably to primitives), `@fizzwiz/sorted` lets you define **custom equivalence classes** using **representation functions**.

This means you can group and sort objects based on structural, semantic, or domain-specific criteria â€” unlocking more meaningful comparisons in everyday code.
