/**
 * This global object provides commonly used comparators as properties:
 * 
 * - `ASCENDING`: Sorts values from smallest to largest.
 * - `DESCENDING`: Sorts values from largest to smallest.
 * - `INSERTION`: Disables sorting; preserves insertion order. 
 * - `SINGULAR`: Treats all values as equivalent â€” only one unique item is allowed in the queue.
 * 
 * These are intended for use with sorted collections, such as {@link Queue}.
